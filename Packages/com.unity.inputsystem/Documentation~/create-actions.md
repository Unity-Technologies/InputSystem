# Create Actions

The simplest way to create actions is to use the [Input Actions editor](ActionsEditor.md) in the Project Settings window. This is the primary recommended workflow and suitable for most scenarios.

However there are many other ways to create actions which might suit less common scenarios. For example, by loading actions from JSON data, or creating actions entirely in code.

### Create Actions using the Action editor

For information on how to create and edit Input Actions in the editor, see the [Input Actions editor](ActionsEditor.md). This is the recommended workflow if you want to organise all your input actions and bindings in one place, which applies across the whole of your project. This often the case for most types of game or app.

### Adding, renaming, duplicating and deleting Actions

* To add a new Action, select the Add (+) icon in the header of the Action column.
* To rename an existing Action, either long-click the name, or right-click the Action and select __Rename__ from the context menu.
* To delete an existing Action, either right-click it and select __Delete__ from the context menu.
* To duplicate an existing Action, either right-click it and select __Duplicate__ from the context menu.





## Other ways to create Actions

The simplest way to create actions is to use the [Input Actions editor](ActionsEditor.md) to configure a set of actions in an asset, as described above. However, because the Input System package API is open and flexible, you can create actions using alternative techniques. These alternatives might be more suitable if you want to customize your project beyond the standard workflow.

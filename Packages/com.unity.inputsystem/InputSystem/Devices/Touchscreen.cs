////TODO: touch is hardwired to certain memory layouts ATM; either allow flexibility or make sure the layouts cannot be changed

////TODO: startTimes are baked *external* times; reset touch when coming out of play mode

////TODO: detect and diagnose touchId=0 events

////REVIEW: where should we put handset vibration support? should that sit on the touchscreen class? be its own separate device?

////REVIEW: Given that Touchscreen is no use for polling, should we remove Touchscreen.current?

////REVIEW: Should Touchscreen reset individual TouchControls to default(TouchState) after a touch has ended? This would allow
////        binding to a TouchControl as a whole and the action would correctly cancel if the touch ends

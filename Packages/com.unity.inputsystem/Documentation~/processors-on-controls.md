### Processors on Controls

You can have any number of Processors directly on an [`InputControl`](../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.InputControl.html), which then process the values read from the Control. Whenever you call [`ReadValue`](../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.InputControl-1.html#UnityEngine_InputSystem_InputControl_1_ReadValue) on a Control, all Processors on that Control process the value before it gets returned to you. You can use [`ReadUnprocessedValue`](../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.InputControl-1.html#UnityEngine_InputSystem_InputControl_1_ReadUnprocessedValue) on a Control to bypass the Processors.

The Input System adds Processors to a Control during device creation, if they're specified in the Control's [layout](Layouts.md). You can't add Processors to existing Controls after they've been created, so you can only add Processors to Controls when you're [creating custom devices](Devices.md#creating-custom-devices). The devices that the Input System supports out of the box already have some useful Processors added on their Controls. For instance, sticks on gamepads have a [Stick Deadzone](#stick-deadzone) Processor.

If you're using a layout generated by the Input System from a [state struct](Devices.md#step-1-the-state-struct) using [`InputControlAttributes`](../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.Layouts.InputControlAttribute.html), you can specify the Processors you want to use via the [`processors`](../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.Layouts.InputControlAttribute.html#UnityEngine_InputSystem_Layouts_InputControlAttribute_processors) property of the attribute, like this:

```CSharp
public struct MyDeviceState : IInputStateTypeInfo
{
    public FourCC format => return new FourCC('M', 'Y', 'D', 'V');

    // Add an axis deadzone to the Control to ignore values
    // smaller then 0.2, as our Control does not have a stable
    // resting position.
    [InputControl(layout = "Axis", processors = "AxisDeadzone(min=0.2)")]
    public short axis;
}
```

If you [create a layout from JSON](Layouts.md#layout-from-json), you can specify Processors on your Controls like this:

```CSharp
{
    "name" : "MyDevice",
    "extend" : "Gamepad", // Or some other thing
    "controls" : [
        {
            "name" : "axis",
            "layout" : "Axis",
            "offset" : 4,
            "format" : "FLT",
            "processors" : "AxisDeadzone(min=0.2)"
        }
    ]
}
```

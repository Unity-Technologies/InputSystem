////TODO: make sure that alterations made to InputSystem.settings in play mode do not leak out into edit mode or the asset

////TODO: handle case of supportFixedUpdates and supportDynamicUpdates both being set to false; should it be an enum?

////TODO: figure out how this gets into a build

////TODO: allow setting up single- and multi-user configs for the project

////TODO: allow enabling/disabling plugins

////REVIEW: should the project settings include a list of action assets to use? (or to force into a build)

////REVIEW: add extra option to enable late-updates?

////REVIEW: put default sensor sampling frequency here?

////REVIEW: put default gamepad polling frequency here?

////REVIEW: Have an InputActionAsset field in here that allows having a single default set of actions that are enabled with no further setup?

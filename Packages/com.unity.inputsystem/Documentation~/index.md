# Input System

The **Input System** allows your users to control your game or app using a device, touch, or gestures.

## Introduction

Unity supports input through two separate systems, one older, and one newer.

The older system, which is built-in to the editor, is called the [Input Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html). The Input Manager is part of the core Unity platform and is the default, if you do not install this Input System Package.

This **Input System package** is a newer, more flexible system, which allows you to use any kind of Input Device to control your Unity content. It's intended to be a replacement for Unity's classic Input Manager. It iss referred to as "The Input System Package", or just **"The Input System"**. To use it, you must [install it into your project using the Package Manager](Installation.md).

During the installation process for the Input System package, the installer offers to automatically deactivate the older built-in system. ([Read more](Installation.md))

To get started, see the [Installation](Installation.md) and [Workflows](Workflows.md) sections. For a demo project, see the [Warriors demo](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/InputSystem_Warriors) on GitHub.

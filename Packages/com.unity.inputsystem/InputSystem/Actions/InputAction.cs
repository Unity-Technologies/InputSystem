////TODO: add way to retrieve the binding correspond to a control

////TODO: add way to retrieve the currently ongoing interaction and also add way to know how long it's been going on

////FIXME: control goes back to invalid when the action ends, so there's no guarantee you can get to the control through the polling API

////FIXME: Whether a control from a binding that's part of a composite appears on an action is currently not consistently enforced.
////       If it mentions the action, it appears on the action. Otherwise it doesn't. The controls should consistently appear on the
////       action based on what action the *composite* references.

////REVIEW: Should we bring the checkboxes for actions back? We tried to "simplify" things by collapsing everything into a InputActionTypes
////        and making the various behavior toggles implicit in that. However, my impression is that this has largely backfired by making
////        it opaque what the choices actually entail and by giving no way out if the choices for one reason or another don't work out
////        perfectly.
////
////        My impression is that at least two the following two checkboxes would make sense:
////        1) Initial State Check? Whether the action should immediately sync to the current state of controls when enabled.
////        2) Resolve Conflicting Inputs? Whether the action should try to resolve conflicts between multiple concurrent inputs.
////
////        I'm fine hiding this under an "Advanced" foldout or something. But IMO, control over this should be available to the user.
////
////        In the same vein, we probably also should expose control over how an action behaves on focus loss (https://forum.unity.com/threads/actions-canceled-when-game-loses-focus.855217/).

////REVIEW: I think the action system as it is today offers too many ways to shoot yourself in the foot. It has
////        flexibility but at the same time has abundant opportunity for ending up with dysfunction. Common setups
////        have to come preconfigured and work robustly for the user without requiring much understanding of how
////        the system fits together.

////REVIEW: add "lastControl" property? (and maybe a lastDevice at the InputActionMap/Asset level?)

////REVIEW: have single delegate instead of separate performed/started/canceled callbacks?

////REVIEW: Do we need to have separate display names for actions?

////REVIEW: what about having the concept of "consumed" on the callback context?

////REVIEW: have "Always Enabled" toggle on actions?

////TODO: allow temporarily disabling individual bindings (flag on binding) such that no re-resolve is needed
////      (SilenceBinding? DisableBinding)

    /// <remarks>
    /// An input action is an abstraction over the source of input(s) it receives. They are
    /// most useful for representing input as "logical" concepts (e.g. "jump") rather than
    /// as "physical" inputs (e.g. "space bar on keyboard pressed").
    ///
    /// In its most basic form, an action is simply an object along with a collection of
    /// bindings that trigger the action.
    ///
    /// <example>
    /// <code>
    /// // A simple action can be created directly using `new`. If desired, a binding
    /// // can be specified directly as part of construction.
    /// var action = new InputAction(binding: "&lt;Gamepad&gt;/buttonSouth");
    ///
    /// // Additional bindings can be added using `AddBinding`.
    /// action.AddBinding("&lt;Mouse&gt;/leftButton");
    /// </code>
    /// </example>
    ///
    /// Bindings use control path expressions to reference controls. See <see cref="InputBinding"/>
    /// for more details. There may be arbitrary many bindings targeting a single action. The
    /// list of bindings targeting an action can be obtained through <see cref="bindings"/>.
    ///
    /// By itself an action does not do anything until it is enabled:
    ///
    /// <example>
    /// <code>
    /// action.Enable();
    /// </code>
    /// </example>
    ///
    /// Once enabled, the action will actively monitor all controls on devices present
    /// in the system (see <see cref="InputSystem.devices"/>) that match any of the binding paths
    /// associated with the action. If you want to restrict the set of bindings used at runtime
    /// or restrict the set of devices which controls are chosen from, you can do so using
    /// <see cref="bindingMask"/> or, if the action is part of an <see cref="InputActionMap"/>,
    /// by setting the <see cref="InputActionMap.devices"/> property of the action map. The
    /// controls that an action uses can be queried using the <see cref="controls"/> property.
    ///
    /// When input is received on controls bound to an action, the action will trigger callbacks
    /// in response. These callbacks are <see cref="started"/>, <see cref="performed"/>, and
    /// <see cref="canceled"/>. The callbacks are triggered as part of input system updates
    /// (see <see cref="InputSystem.Update"/>), i.e. they happen before the respective
    /// <c>MonoBehaviour.Update</c> or <c>MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate</c> methods
    /// get executed (depending on which <see cref="InputSettings.updateMode"/> the system is
    /// set to).
    ///
    /// In what order and how those callbacks get triggered depends on both the <see cref="type"/>
    /// of the action as well as on the interactions (see <see cref="IInputInteraction"/>) present
    /// on the bindings of the action. The default behavior is that when a control is actuated
    /// (that is, moving away from its resting position), <see cref="started"/> is called and then
    /// <see cref="performed"/>. Subsequently, whenever the a control further changes value to
    /// anything other than its default value, <see cref="performed"/> will be called again.
    /// Finally, when the control moves back to its default value (i.e. resting position),
    /// <see cref="canceled"/> is called.
    ///
    /// To hook into the callbacks, there are several options available to you. The most obvious
    /// one is to hook directly into <see cref="started"/>, <see cref="performed"/>, and/or
    /// <see cref="canceled"/>. In these callbacks, you will receive a <see cref="CallbackContext"/>
    /// with information about how the action got triggered. For example, you can use <see
    /// cref="CallbackContext.ReadValue{TValue}"/> to read the value from the binding that triggered
    /// or use <see cref="CallbackContext.interaction"/> to find the interaction that is in progress.
    ///
    /// <example>
    /// <code>
    /// action.started += context => Debug.Log($"{context.action} started");
    /// action.performed += context => Debug.Log($"{context.action} performed");
    /// action.canceled += context => Debug.Log($"{context.action} canceled");
    /// </code>
    /// </example>
    ///
    /// Alternatively, you can use the <see cref="InputActionMap.actionTriggered"/> callback for
    /// actions that are part of an action map or the global <see cref="InputSystem.onActionChange"/>
    /// callback to globally listen for action activity. To simply record action activity instead
    /// of responding to it directly, you can use <see cref="InputActionTrace"/>.
    ///
    /// If you prefer to poll an action directly as part of your <c>MonoBehaviour.Update</c>
    /// or <c>MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate</c> logic, you can do so using the <see cref="triggered"/>
    /// and <see cref="ReadValue{TValue}"/> methods.
    ///
    /// <example>
    /// <code>
    /// protected void Update()
    /// {
    ///     // For a button type action.
    ///     if (action.triggered)
    ///         /* ... */;
    ///
    ///     // For a value type action.
    ///     // (Vector2 is just an example; pick the value type that is the right
    ///     // one according to the bindings you have)
    ///     var v = action.ReadValue&lt;Vector2&gt;();
    /// }
    /// </code>
    /// </example>
    ///
    /// Note that actions are not generally frame-based. What this means is that an action
    /// will observe any value change on its connected controls, even if the control changes
    /// value multiple times in the same frame. In practice, this means that, for example,
    /// no button press will get missed.
    ///
    /// Actions can be grouped into maps (see <see cref="InputActionMap"/>) which can in turn

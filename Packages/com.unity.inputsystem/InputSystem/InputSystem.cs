////TODO: allow aliasing processors etc

////REVIEW: rename all references to "frame" to refer to "update" instead (e.g. wasPressedThisUpdate)?

////TODO: add APIs to get to the state blocks (equivalent to what you currently get with e.g. InputSystem.devices[0].currentStatePtr)

////FIXME: modal dialogs (or anything that interrupts normal Unity operation) are likely a problem for the system as is; there's a good
////       chance the event queue will just get swamped; should be only the background queue though so I guess once it fills up we
////       simply start losing input but it won't grow infinitely

////REVIEW: make more APIs thread-safe?

////REVIEW: it'd be great to be able to set up monitors from control paths (independently of actions; or should we just use actions?)

////REVIEW: have InputSystem.onTextInput that's fired directly from the event processing loop?
////        (and allow text input events that have no associated target device? this way we don't need a keyboard to get text input)

////REVIEW: split lower-level APIs (anything mentioning events and state) off into InputSystemLowLevel API to make this API more focused?

////TODO: release native allocations when exiting

        ///         // So now we know that we want to build a layout on the fly

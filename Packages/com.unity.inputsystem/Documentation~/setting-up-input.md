# Setting up input

Learn how to configure input to suit the needs of your project.

User input comes in many forms, from keyboard, mouse, gamepads, and more. The Input System allows you to configure the connection and meaning between controls on your user's physical input devices, and the way your game or app responds to those inputs.

Once you have set up input, you can then [respond to input](respond-to-input.md).

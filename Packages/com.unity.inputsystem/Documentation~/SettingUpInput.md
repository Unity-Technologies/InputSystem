# Setting up input

Learn how to configure input to suit the needs of your project.

User input comes in many forms, from keyboard, mouse, gamepads, and more. Configuring input means you define the meaning of the controls on your users devices, as well as details such as 

One or two paragraphs: Describe the key themes of the subpages, and link
to background context. No headings, images, or tables.

Final paragraph (optional): Links to related documentation the user
might be looking for instead.

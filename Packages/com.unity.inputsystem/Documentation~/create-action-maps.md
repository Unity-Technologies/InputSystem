# Create Action Maps

Action maps provide a way to group collections of Actions that represent different input scenarios in your project (such as UI navigation, gameplay, etc.)

Actions must belong to an Action Map, therefore if you are starting with an empty Actions Asset, you must create an action map before you can create any actions.

The Action Maps section of the Actions Editor allows you to create, rename, delete, and duplicate Action Maps.

* To add a new Action Map, select the Add (+) icon in the header of the Action Map panel.
* To rename an existing Action Map, either long-click the name, or right-click the Action Map and select __Rename__ from the context menu. Note that Action Map names can't contain slashes  (`/`).
* To delete an existing Action Map, right-click it and select __Delete__ from the context menu.
* To duplicate an existing Action Map, right-click it and select __Duplicate__ from the context menu.

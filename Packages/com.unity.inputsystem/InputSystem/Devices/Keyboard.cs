    /// Note:
    /// Unity input system key codes and input manager key codes are designed with game controls in mind.
    ///
    /// This means the way they are assigned is intended to preserve the location of keys on keyboards,
    /// so that pressing a key in the same location on different keyboards should result in the same action
    /// regardless of what is printed on a key or what current system language is set.
    ///
    /// This means, for example, that <see cref="A"/> is always the key to the right of <see cref="CapsLock"/>,
    /// regardless of which key (if any) produces the "a" character on the current keyboard layout.
    ///
    /// Unity relies on physical hardware in the keyboards to report same USB HID "usage" for the keys in
    /// the same location.This puts a practical limit on what can be achieved, because different keyboards
    /// might report different data, and this is outside of Unity's control.
    ///
    /// For this reason, you should not use key codes to read text input.
    /// Instead, you should use the <see cref="Keyboard.onTextInput"/> callback.
    /// The `onTextInput` callback provides you with the actual text characters which correspond
    /// to the symbols printed on a keyboard, based on the end user's current system language layout.
    ///
    /// To find the text character (if any) generated by a key according to the currently active keyboard
    /// layout, use the <see cref="InputControl.displayName"/> property of <see cref="KeyControl"/>.
